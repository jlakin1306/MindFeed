# MindFeed: An Educational Scrolling Experience

## About

MindFeed transforms everyday scrolling into meaningful learning moments. This educational app generates AI-powered videos that make learning any topic fast, enjoyable, and accessible to everyone.

## What It Does

MindFeed creates short educational videos on demand, delivering content in two unique styles:

- **Academic Mode**: Straightforward learning with clear explanations
- **Brainrot Mode**: Fun, entertaining delivery inspired by social media trends

Simply enter a topic you want to learn about, choose your preferred mode, and MindFeed generates a custom video just for you. All videos are saved locally so you can revisit them anytime.

## Why We Built This

AI has made its way into education, but it's often controversial—sometimes misused to cheat rather than to learn. We believe AI presents incredible opportunities to personalize learning and make knowledge more accessible. MindFeed aims to democratize education by turning scrolling into an engaging, productive experience.

## How It Works

The app uses a modular frontend and backend architecture:

- The **frontend** provides the scrolling feed interface and user controls
- The **backend** handles video generation using AI, combining the user's topic prompt with their chosen mode
- Videos are stored locally on your device for easy access

We're currently using a placeholder for video generation, with plans to integrate OpenAI's Sora API to deliver high-quality, affordable AI-generated educational content.

## Future Goals

We plan to partner with underfunded school districts to make MindFeed accessible to students who need it most, helping close the technology gap and providing cutting-edge learning materials at an affordable cost.
